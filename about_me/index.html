    <p>I am married and have 6 children and 3 grandchildren. We only have one child left at home now.</p>
    <P>I am currently finishing my BS in Professional Studies. This class is the first class for my Web Frontends certificate.
    I have had to maintain websites for the schools where I work.
    <br>However, I am not writing the HTML/CSS from the ground-up, usually just editing.
    I hope this class and certificate will push me to the next level.<br>
    I look forward to using what I learn in this class to create some custom webpages for my job.</p>
