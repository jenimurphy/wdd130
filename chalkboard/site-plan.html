      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>This site will provide a chalboard-like repository for teachers and staff.
        The chalkboard site will contain important links, dates, reminders, and calendars
        in one location on the school website, rather than buried in the emails where the 
        information was originally delivered.

Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

        Welcome to Hayden Peak's Chalkboard! 
        Here you will find calendars, links, and reminders that are usually buried
        in your email. The Hayden Peak Chalkboard will provide a repository for information that is referenced by the teachers and staff.  This information often needs to be referred back to during the week and gets buried in emails.  This site will be updated weekly. The weekly newsletter from Jen Smith will be posted here. If you have any suggestions on things you would like to see added to our Chalkboard, click on the 
        suggestions link below.

      <h3>CALENDARS</h3>
      <p>
        This page gives you a central place to view all of the calendars for the school.  Any events or rooms that need to be scheduled can also be done from this page.  Please submit any room request or event request using the link below.  If you see an event that needs to be changed, please email Jeni as soon as possible.

        Please remember when scheduling the gym or the stage that it is your responsibility to coordinate with the PE teachers.  They use the gym all day, every day, and they will need to adjust their lesson plans if they are not in their “classroom,” otherwise known as the gym.
        
        <h3>Gym Setup Request (Request form link here)</h3>
        Please remember to submit a gym set-up request form for Armando. Please submit this request as soon as you schedule the gym.  Indicate if you need to reserve the whole gym, half of the gym and what kind of seating is needed as well.  If you need the screen down and the stage curtains opened, you indicate this on that form as well.
        
        <h3>Projector Equipment</h3>
        If you need to have the projector or other AV equipment set-up, please be sure to add that to your room request.
        <br>If you need to add an event to either calendar, please submit the Room/Event Request form attached below.

      <h3>ASSIGNMENTS</h3>
      <p>
       Assignments for Crossing Duty, Faculty Room, and Soup & Salad are listed below.
       <br>Please be sure to mark your own calendars with the dates of your assignments.
       <br>If you have any questions or see something that needs to be corrected please let Jeni know.

      This is where you can see staff assignments for the following:
     <h3>Crossing-Duty (link to schedule)</h3>
      The schedule for faculty is for weekly assignments.
      Please be at your assigned location no later than 8:10 am until 8:25 am and after school from 3:05 pm until 3:15.  If you have a sub on a day that you have crossing duty, please make arrangements to trade with someone on your team or with another grade-level team.

      <h3>Faculty Room Cleaning: (link to schedule) </h3> 
      Each team has 3 week-long cleaning assignments during the school year. Please review the cleaning chart on the wall in the faculty room.  We all benefit from this space, even if we don’t sit in here to eat lunch.  We enjoy this space when we have our monthly potlucks, payday pop, etc.  If there are items that need to be re-stocked, such as cups, napkins, silverware, or dish soap, please let Jeni know.

     <h3>Soup & Salad Potluck Luncheon: (link to schedule)</h3>
      On the second Wednesday of each month, the Soup & Salad potluck is held.  Each person that signed up has about 3 assignments during this school year.  Reminders will be placed in your box the week before the potluck.  If you are unable to bring your assigned dish, please review the schedule and trade with someone.  Please let Jeni know if you do trade so she can update the schedule.  

      <h4>Treat Week – December 12th to 16th</h4>
      Instead of our potluck on Wednesday, in December, we will a week of treats.  Please review the schedule to see when you are assigned to bring treats that week.  We will have the treat table set up all day, each day.  If you cannot bring treats on your assigned day, let Jeni know and try to trade with someone on another day.
